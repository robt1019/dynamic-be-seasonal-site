	<h1>Dynamic Be Seasonal - Report</h1>

	<h3>Instructions for use</h3>

		<h4></h4>

			<p>To run the server and load the site, enter the following command from within the project folder 'nodemon bin/www' and point your browser to 'http://localhost:3000'.</p>

			<p>'nodemon' means that the server doesn't have to be restarted if changes are made to project files</p>

			<p>The site will load the produce checker page first, and navigating to previous or next months will display new produce specific to that month. Clicking on an item of produce will display information about the item in a pop up box. New pages that weren't present on the original client site are 'Produce List', 'Months' and 'Admin'.</p>

			<p>'Admin' allows the adding, removal and editing of produce items into both the produce table, and the months table, for use by the site. 'Produce List' and 'Months' display the items currently stored in the produce and the months database. Currently anyone can access these pages which is not ideal. Given more time I would have looked to implement user accounts and privileged log-ins for these pages.</p>

	<h3>Configuration or programming of a server</h3>
		
		<h4>Express</h4>
			
			<p>I relied heavily on the Express framework for the server code. My main learning resources were a series of online tutorials, as well as the NodeJS and Express documentation. The most useful tutorials, and those which most heavily influenced the design of the server code were the three tutorials mentioned below.</p>

			<a href="cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/">Tutorial 1</a>

			<a href="http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/">Tutorial 1</a>

			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU">Tutorial 2</a>

			<p>Express builds a basic scaffolding for a dynamic site, consisting of a main 'app.js' file, as well as folders for 'routes' (code related to routing), 'views' (code related to what is displayed on the screen) and 'node_modules'(additional modules installed via the node package manager, 'npm').</p>

			<p>'app.js' is generated by Express with a lot of code already completed. Any new code in this file has been marked new. Anything not marked new was generated by Express and is not my code.</p>

			<p>Routing requests are processed from 'index.js'(Static web pages) and 'database.js'(all routing and requests related to the database').</p>
		

	<h3>Attachment of a database system, and/or integration of other open source libraries or packages</h3>
		
		<h4>SQLite database</h4>

			<p>I used the SQlite3 node module installed via npm to deal with the attachment of a database to the site. This module allows for interaction with a SQLite database from within node programs, and includes code for processing SQL statements more securely. Installation of modules via Express involves specifying any new modules in the automatically generated 'package.json' file, and then running an 'npm install' command.</p>

			<p>The database is set up and created in 'app.js' and then manipulated via routing requests in 'database.js' in the 'routes' folder</p>


	<h3>Design and implementation of a complete dynamic web site</h3>

		<h4>Overall Design</h4>

			<p>I decided to largely use the Express framework's default layout for structuring the web site. This meant keeping routing code in the routes folder, html in the views folder, and performing any initial app setup in the 'app.js' file. This also meant converting existing html to jade code for use in routing operations via the 'views' folder. This was acheived using a code conversion website so is probably not the prettiest, but it does work and saved a large amount of time. Stylesheets and existing javascripts, as well as any images, were kept in the 'public' folder and work in the same way as they did on the previous client site. All code in this folder aside from that in the jquery and bootstrap folders is my own.</p>

			<p>All dynamic aspects of the site are event driven and are processed through the routing code in the 'routes' folder. This code consists at the momenet entirely of 'Get' and 'Post' requests, for both rendering web-pages, and interacting with the database.</p>
		
		<h4>Database</h4>

			<p>The be_seasonal.db database consists of two tables. 'produce' stores a unique id, name, description, and image file for all produce items. 'months' stores a unique id, month name, and a foreign key reference to a produce item.</p>


		<h4>Security</h4>

			<p>Security is very basic, and needs a lot of work. SQL injections are protected against, but currently anyone can use the admin page, as user accounts and log-ins have not been implemented. The site only runs on 'http://localhost:3000' at the moment</p>

		<h4>Integration with existing code</h4>

			<p>The Be-Seasonal client site relied heavily on a javascript for displaying and manipulating information about produce items. As the site is basically designed to perform only one function (displaying seasonal produce by month), I decided the most useful functionality for making the site dynamic would be the ability to store and amend produce data by month in a database, and have the exisiting javascript interact with this database.</p>

			<p>To achieve this, limited JQuery was used to make calls to relevant routing code in the routes folder from within the client javascript file 'scriptfile.	js', saved in the 'public/javascripts' folder.</p>

			<p>This allowed the 'scriptfile.js' file to retrieve produce and month information from the be-seasonal.db database, and perform event-driven operations based on this information.</p>

			<p>Month images and objects are not stored in the database, but produce items (fruit and veg), as well as information on what produce is available by month are. This makes it far simpler to update and maintain the website</p>
